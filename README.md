I developed this application on my own mainly to experiment with some new tools and libraries that I hadn't been exposed
to and to also solve a problem I had with keeping track of company vehicles.

Open source libraries that were used include:

Dagger 2
RxJava 1
RxAndroid
RxBindings
LeakCanary
Google Firebase, Data Binding, Design, Cardview, RecyclerView, AppCompat libraries
Retrolambda
Realm
Android Material Icons
Material Tap Target
Material Dialogs
Material About Library
